# E-Commerce

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

This project is a fully functional e-commerce application developed using Angular. It allows users to browse products, select currencies, and add items to a shopping cart. 
The project is built to interact with a GraphQL server and uses Angular Material for UI components and Angular Flex-Layout for responsive layout.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Browse and search for products.
- **Currency Selection**: Choose different currencies to view product prices.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add items to the cart and view them.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on various devices.

## Get started

This project uses a GraphQL endpoint - [endpoint](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint)
In order to start this endpoint, follow these steps:
1. **Install dependencies**.
2. **Build the project - yarn build**.
3. **Start the project - yarn start**.

The endpoint will be available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
